# BrewingHibiscusAddon
You can now brew hibiscus flowers into tea, offering a new drink item that gives beneficial effects. This is the first addon I have ever released!

This addon adds 5 new types of hibiscus flowers to your world! Each flower has a special effect hidden within, which can only be brought out through tea!

To make this tea, you need to create a tea brewer. There are two versions.

The first is the Natural Tea Brewer.
