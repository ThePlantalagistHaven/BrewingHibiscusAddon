# BrewingHibiscusAddon
You can now brew hibiscus flowers into tea, offering a new drink item that gives beneficial effects. This is the first addon I have ever released!

![AddonBrewingHibiscusShowPage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5756d57d-af18-4da0-9aaf-338a23df460e)

This addon adds 5 new types of hibiscus flowers to your world! Each flower has a special effect hidden within, which can only be brought out through tea!

These flowers come from bushes that you can find from all over the Overworld and Nether!

By using bonemeal on the non flowered variants, you can cause them to bloom, and using shears will harvest the flowers! By bonemealing the flowered version, however, you can cause a hibiscus tree to grow!

And with this new wood, you can use a new woodset!

Again you can use the leaves, bushes, and flowers as decoration! Some of these can even go in flower pots! Use them to spice up your builds.

To make this hibiscus tea, you need to create a tea brewer machine. There are two tiers.

The first is the Natural Tea Brewer. 

![678b8ed3-629d-4cab-b298-7bb6c2a93b6c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed9d810b-e1f9-4742-8595-41e50e3446f1)

This is made of 4 bricks, 1 block of sand, 1 block of gravel, and 2 hibiscus flowers. To start the process, you need a clay cup made of 1 brick and use it to interact with the machine, along with a bottle of water and at least 10 of one hibiscus flower in your inventory. You can choose the amount of flowers you want to use, which will determine the strength and duration of the effect. After confirming, the machine will brew some tea for you to drink.

The second tier is the Modern Tea Brewer.

![6ccd5f0c-07da-4883-a746-5ee7cb3c2f7e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac1a6c25-7b01-4cba-b112-75befba57b28)

This is made of 4 iron ingots, 2 blocks of glass, 1 Natural Tea Brewer, and 2 hibiscus flowers. Very similar to the metal flask, but you need a metal flask, made of 2 iron ingots, and use it to interact with the machine, along with a bottle of water and at least 10 of one hibiscus flower in your inventory. With this machine, you can have more than one hibiscus type in the brew, leading to a drink with multiple beneficial effects! This machine also allows for more flowers, leading to a stronger effect and duration.

Don't worry, you'll receive a book that will help explain the locations of hibiscus bushes and other info...

# Credits

Pretty much almost everything was done by me!
However, lots of the models for the woodset came from Kaioga's Templates!
The flower pot model was gotten from MeerkatMC's Custom Pot template!

# Current Issues
When placing a hibiscus door next to an open door, if the door has solid blocks behind it, both segments become misaligned. I suggest placing the hibiscus door down first, then placing solid blocks behind.
